//! Benchmark tool and library for the Praxis proxy.
//!
//! `praxis-benchmarks` orchestrates external load generators
//! ([Vegeta], [Fortio]) to benchmark proxy servers,
//! collect structured results, and produce comparison reports.
//!
//! This crate is both a library (used by the `xtask benchmark`
//! command) and a standalone benchmark suite (criterion benches).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`proxy::ProxyConfig`] trait: pluggable proxy definitions
//! - [`scenario::Scenario`]: configures which proxies and
//!   workloads to run
//! - [`result::ScenarioResults`]: collected metrics with JSON
//!   serialization, YAML reports, and comparison support
//! - [`runner::Runner`]: orchestrates warmup, measurement,
//!   multiple runs, and median reporting
//! - [`tools`]: wrappers around external load generators
//!
